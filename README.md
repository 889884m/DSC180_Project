# DSC180 Capstone Project

Most of the project code was acutally built using Jupyter Notebooks, so the latest working code would be found in the `Notebooks` folder.

To build the `docker build -t <tag_name> .` which gives a local docker container with the libraries scipy, numpy, pandas, pytorch, and sklearn.
